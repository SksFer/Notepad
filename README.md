# Notepad
This code is a simple text editor developed using the Tkinter library in Python. It defines several functions to handle creating, opening, saving, and editing text files. When the application starts, it sets up a main window with a text area and a menu that includes options for "New File," "Open File," "Save File," and "Save As," along with editing functions like "Copy," "Cut," and "Paste." The New_file function clears the text area, Open_file allows the user to select a text file to open and load its content into the text area, while Save_file and Save_as enable saving changes to the current file or choosing a new location to save it. The editing functions use the event_generate method to perform copy, cut, and paste operations on the selected text. Finally, the application enters its main event loop with window.mainloop().
